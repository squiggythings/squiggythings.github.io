                <p>
                    An educational toy/tool to teach young children about synthesis and music theory.<br />On the left
                    you can drag around the squids to arrange notes in a sequence, and press play to hear it. On the
                    right are various settings and effects that change the synth's sound.<br />Any knob can be automated
                    by sticking one of the 4 starfish onto it.

                <p>
                    The first and most popular game I released, Wonderflower is a 30-40 minute long game about a girl
                    named Sherbet and her cat, Gelato, trying to plant a flower in a flower-less city. Features a cast
                    of memorable characters, lighthearted dialogue, and a metroid-style map progression.<br />Made with
                    Unity, coded in C#, Music made with FL Studio 20, and all visuals drawn in Aseprite.

                <p>
                    An interactive piece made for the Trenton Free Public Library. Each machine was historically made by
                    the Crosley Machine Company, and all made unique sounds. The machines can be turned on and off to
                    create a small rhythm.
                    <br />
                    Made with Unity, all graphics drawn in Aseprite, and audio assembled in FL Studio 20.

                <h2>Windy Ribbon AR installation</h2>
                <p>
                    An augmented reality piece as part of a project to enhance existing sculptures in New Hope, PA. I
                    worked in a team of four artists to add an interactive AR experience to the sculpture "Windy Ribbon"
                    by Richard Pitts. Accessible by scanning a QR code outside the sculpture using the Hoverlay app.

                <h2>Water-Pipe Organ</h2>
                <p>
                    Inspired by Wintergatan's marble machine and Daisuke Amaya's "Rain", the pipes will drip water onto
                    the instruments to play a song: ("Yakan Kouro" by fox capture plan). You can click the faucets to
                    turn on and off the different instruments. Silence an instrument and then click above it to play
                    along for yourself.
                    <br />Graphics drawn in Aseprite, and the whole thing was coded in p5.js. The arrangement of "Yakan
                    Kouro" I made in Famitracker 0CC and then imported the stems as .txt files into the project.

                <h2>Goo</h2>
                <p>
                    Goo is a p5.js experiment with an alternative way to tell time, using a tactile "touch"
                    experience.<br />
                    The goo starts out very soft and malleable and gets firmer and more volatile as the day goes on.
                    You're able to get a rough idea of what time it is only by interacting with the goo.<br />How solid
                    it feels indicates how late in the day it is, and the pitch of the sound it makes indicates how far
                    into the hour it is.
