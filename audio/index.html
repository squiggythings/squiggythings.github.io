                    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Elias, an audio programmer from New Jersey.</p>

                    <p>
                        I have over 6 years of experience in game development and audio. With a strong programming
                        background, I love to build robust systems for incredibly adaptive game audio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am working on audio for the upcoming action-adventure title, Insignia by
                        <a href="https://upponhill.com/">Uppon Hill</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am also the creator of the open source chiptune music making software,
                        <a href="https://wavetracker.org">WaveTracker</a>.

                <h2>WaveTracker</h2>
                <p>
                    An advanced chiptune music software, WaveTracker lets the user draw in up to 100 custom sound waves,
                    and use them in up to 100 custom instrument presets. It also features 24 sound channels, a noise
                    generator for drums, a multitude of effects, importing and editing audio samples, and a built-in
                    song visualizer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are lots of cool digital signal processing effects under the hood, such as frequency
                    modulation between two waves, lowpass filters and global downsampling, and even a custom "smart"
                    resampling mode that reacts to the drawn wave to preserve crispness for sharper waves but not be too
                    harsh for smoother waves.

                <h2>Insignia</h2>
                <p>
                    Insignia is an upcoming action adventure game by Uppon Hill. I am the lead sound designer on the
                    project, responsible for all of the audio asset design and implementation.
                </p>
                <p>We use FMOD Studio to integrate the audio into the game engine, Unity.</p>
                <p>
                    I also help design and develop tooling to allow for an easier audio workflow for both myself and the
                    game's composer, such as C# scripts extending FMOD's built in spatializer functionality to allow for
                    greater control over distance attenuation for certain objects, and a system that lets us easily
                    assign background music and ambience tracks to scenes, which play seamlessly without having to write
                    any additional code.

                <p>
                    An educational toy/tool to teach young children about synthesis and music theory.<br />On the left
                    you can drag around the squids to arrange notes in a sequence, and press play to hear it. On the
                    right are various settings and effects that change the synth's sound.<br />Any knob can be automated
                    by sticking one of the 4 starfish onto it.<br />The sound engine is a simple FM synthesizer
                    controlled by an ADSR volume envelope.

                <h2>Crosley Singing Machines</h2>
                <p>
                    An interactive piece made for the Trenton Free Public Library. Each machine was historically made by
                    the Crosley Machine Company, and all made unique sounds. The machines can be turned on and off to
                    create a small rhythm.
                    <br />
                    Made with Unity, all graphics drawn in Aseprite, and audio assembled in FL Studio 20.

                <h2>Abyss Demo</h2>
                <p>
                    A short platformer made to showcase adaptive music & audio systems. I drew all the graphics and
                    programmed the gameplay, but this project is mainly meant to show off the dynamic sound design and
                    score.
                    <br />
                    Here, I created a bunch of C# components to allow me to easily author spatial ambience sounds and
                    slightly randomize sound events. There is also an adaptive music system that changes the arrangement
                    based on game progress. Notice how the music becomes more full the higher the player climbs.

                <p>
                    Inspired by Wintergatan's marble machine and Daisuke Amaya's "Rain", the pipes will drip water onto
                    the instruments to play a song: ("Yakan Kouro" by fox capture plan). You can click the faucets to
                    turn on and off the different instruments. Silence an instrument and then click above it to play
                    along for yourself.
                    <br />Graphics drawn in Aseprite, and the whole thing was coded in p5.js. The arrangement of "Yakan
                    Kouro" I made in Famitracker 0CC and then imported the stems as .txt files into the project.

                <h2>Goo</h2>
                <p>
                    Goo is a p5.js experiment with an alternative way to tell time, using a tactile "touch"
                    experience.<br />
                    The goo starts out very soft and malleable and gets firmer and more volatile as the day goes on.
                    You're able to get a rough idea of what time it is only by interacting with the goo and listening to
                    the sound it makes.<br />How solid it feels indicates how late in the day it is, and the pitch of
                    the sound indicates how far into the hour it is.

                <h2>Penguin Surfing</h2>
                <p>
                    A small infinite runner game where you play as a penguin surfing on the sea. Jump on fish to gain
                    points, and avoid rocks. Made in Unity with handmade graphics and sound effects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The surfing sound is dependent on the velocity and direction of the player movement, which makes for
                    a much more natural gameplay experience.
