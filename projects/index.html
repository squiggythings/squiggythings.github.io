				<h2>WaveTracker</h2>
				<p>
					An in-development advanced chiptune music software. WaveTracker lets you draw in up to 100 custom sound waves, and use them in up to 100
					custom instrument presets. It also features 24 sound channels, a multitude of effects, importing and editing audio samples, and a built-in song
					visualizer. <br /> To the left is a demo of the visualizer, playing an arrangement I made of fearofdark's "Rolling Down the Street, In My Katamari".

				<h2>Water-Pipe Organ</h2>
				<p>
					Inspired by Wintergatan's marble machine and Daisuke Amaya's "Rain", the pipes will drip water onto the instruments to play a song: ("Yakan
					Kouro" by fox capture plan). You can click the faucets to turn on and off the different instruments. Silence an instrument and then click
					above it to play along for yourself.
					<br />Graphics drawn in Aseprite, and the whole thing was coded in p5.js. The arrangement of "Yakan Kouro" I made in Famitracker 0CC and
					then imported the stems as .txt files into the project.

				<h2>Goo</h2>
				<p>
					Goo is a p5.js experiment with an alternative way to tell time, using a tactile "touch" experience. The goo starts out very soft and
					malleable and gets firmer and more volatile as the day goes on. You're able to get a rough idea of what time it is only by interacting with
					the goo. How solid it feels indicates how late in the day it is, and the pitch of the sound it makes indicates how far into the hour it is.

				<h2>Spudbud</h2>
				<p>
					Spudbud is a very small game I worked on with my friends over a weekend for Global Game Jam 2023. I was only responsible for the
					programming, but we had a lot of fun! You play as a potato who can grow or shrink through his roots. You need to collect water in order to
					grow the roots while also avoiding yellow fungus, worm missiles, and spiders.
