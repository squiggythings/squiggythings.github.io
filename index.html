        For a couple years now I have been part of an online musical group
        called Pxtunes, based around the pxTone Collage music editor by Daisuke
        Amaya. It's a super supportive environment and a fantastic place to hone
        my skills and expand my knowledge as a musician. I love all the
        wonderful people I've met there Here are some tracks I have done for
        their larger projects, though not all of them were made in pxTone.
        <br />You can listen to our albums
        <a href="https://pxtunes.bandcamp.com/music">here</a>!

        </h3>
        <p>
          An uptempo jazz arrangement of Astronautilus' second stage theme by
          neozoid. I arranged/performed it as an imaginary jazz quartet: drums,
          piano, bass, and trombone.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot of improvisation in this arrangement and attention to
          detail with the other "players" subtle reactions to the current solo.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Check it out at the 1 minute mark! The trombone starts playing
          stacatto eight notes, and a couple beats later the pianist follows it
          with the same rhythm, just like they would in a live set!)

          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          An electronic arrangement of the fifth and final zone of Astronautilus
          by neozoid. I added a lot of new harmonies and textures not found in
          the original. Since this is the final level theme, I tried to lean
          hard into creating an emotionally intense, "you can do it!" type of
          feeling, especially in the second half.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was made in pxTone Collage, the same program the original track
          was made in, but this version has a whopping 40 tracks. Everything you hear is nothing but repitched
          samples! pxTone is a pretty barebones program, so all the pumping
          sidechaining in the bass and the pads are actually just hand drawn
          volume envelopes!

        <p>
          Secret Porta was an event we did around the holidays modeled after
          "Secret Santa" gift exchanges. Each of us was randomly assigned
          another person to cover music from, then we shared them with each
          other and had a great time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was assigned my friend ArcOfDream who wrote the score for a game
          called Monolith. This is my interpretation of the Monolith soundtrack,
          inspired by Danny Baranowsky's sounds and textures. I was listening to
          a lot of Nerve and Jojo Mayer too, the beginning build up is very
          inspired by Jojo's drumming.

        <p>
          To celebrate pxtunes being 5 years old, we released an album of
          originals by each of us, without any theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          I opted to go for a quirky chiptune-y jazz/funk song, with minimal
          instrumentation, unlike some of my other pxTone work. It has a lot of
          rather complex harmonies and chord progressions and a few improvised
          solos too.

        </h3>
        <p>
          This was the first pxtunes album I took part in, a couple months after
          I joined. We each remixed a track from the Kero Blaster Soundtrack by Daisuke Amaya. (The same person who made pxTone Collage itself!)
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to try and push the limits of what pxTone Collage is capable of. By layering different basic wave instruments on top of each other, you're able to create some pretty complex sounds. It alternates between a mellow soft style and an energetic dance style, all reimagining elements of the orginal song.

          This is probably my favorite song by Daisuke Amaya, "Time Table" from
          his game, Kero Blaster. It has a hauntingly beautiful main melody and
          an oh-so-lovely chromatically descending bassline (which I'm a sucker
          for!)
        </p>
        <p>
          I did a smooth and intimate arrangement in Famitracker, with the VRC6
          and VRC7 expansion chips. There's a lot of added harmony with the
          6 FM channels on the VRC7 playing crunchy electric piano chords.
