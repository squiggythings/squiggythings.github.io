Dream Dining: Disco! is a very small experimental arcade game combining rhythm, and cooking elements. The player must serve a burger the correct customer order, but every input has to be on-beat with the music. The goal is to serve as many customers as accurately as possible before the song ends. This is one of the games made in Scratch.
All pixel art made in Aseprite, music in FL Studio 20.

### Cabra

Cabra is a game I've been working on slowly over the past few years in Unity. It's based around a metroidvania style of gameplay, focused on exploration, narrative and combat.

Noreidia is a small top-down exploration based-RPG very inspired by the original Legend of Zelda. I've been developing it for the past couple months in Unity, alongside Cabra.
I expect to finish it sometime by the beginning of 2021.
All pixel art made in Aseprite, music and sounds in Famitracker 0CC, and level design in Tiled.
