        <h2>The Deep Sea Funk, Tango and Dance</h2>
        <p>
          This is a track of me playing with the "Jaws" theme and taking it into
          unexpected places musically.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was kind of an exercise in writing vastly different genres, as
          noted by the title, it starts as Jaws, then switches to a
          chiptune-funk, back to Jaws, and into an uptempo tango or milonga
          style, and then closes out with a more electronic pumping dance sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          I submitted this to a Battle of The Bits competition about Sea
          Monsters, and won second place!

        <h2>Slice & Dice</h2>
        <p>A fun chiptune, latin jazz track I did in pxTone Collage.</p>
        <p>
          I also submitted this one to Battle of The Bits. Every summer they
          have a huge "Summer Chip" competition that lasts months that gets
          hundreds of entries. <br /><br />
          This track won first place among entries in the pxTone category, and
          17th overall.

        <h2>The Three Toed Amigos</h2>

        <p>
          This track was originally for a friends' game about a cat fighting a
          bunch of birds. Each bird would give you a power that you could use
          against the others like in Megaman.
          <br />
          The game never ended up being finished, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each bird was based on different species from around the world. This
          was the theme for the toucan from Central/South America. The music has
          a lot of Latin Samba rhythms but uses Spanish Flamenco harmonies to
          create a more serious mood.
        </p>

        <p>
          This track was created in Famitracker with the VRC6 and MMC5 expansion
          chips.
